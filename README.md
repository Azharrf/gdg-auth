# GDG AUTH (STUDY JAM 1)

This project is a simple implementation of HTML and CSS to create a user interface for a website. The task focuses on building three essential pages: Login, Registration, and Home.

1. **Login Page:** A basic form where users can input their credentials (username and password) to access the website.
2. **Registration Page:** A form for new users to sign up by providing details such as username, email, and password.
3. **Home Page:** A welcoming page that serves as the landing page after successful login or registration.

The goal of this mini-task is to practice structuring a web page using semantic HTML and styling it with CSS to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
